[tshark.dev](https://tshark.dev) exists to teach you about packet analysis.

The main aim for the site is to provide example usage of
working with packets and hopefully give back something
to the networking community in the process.

This website is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source static
site generator. Most of the HTML/CSS/JS, shortcodes, and partials come from the [Learn Theme](https://learn.netlify.com/en/).

## Guide Philosophy

- If you can't understand an article, that's a bug
- Bad style and tone are high-priority issues
- Prefer linking to articles than writing new ones
- Link to manpages/Wireshark docs wherever relevant
- Further reading links should provide something that the article above it does not
