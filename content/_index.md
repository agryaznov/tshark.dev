[Wireshark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark) is used for Passive Network Analysis to diagnose network issues. tshark provides a CLI for this tool.
This guide provides examples and direction on how to use tshark and pitfalls to avoid. This is a living, breathing guide. If youâ€™d like to contribute, [fork me on GitHub](https://github.com/pocc/tshark.dev)!

### How is this different from Wireshark docs?

Wireshark documentation is sufficient to document a feature's existance, but not its usage. It's a reference, not a guide.

If you have a Wireshark question, there are mayn good resources like the [Official Documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/), 
the [manpages](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/), or you can  ask a question on [Wireshark Forums](ask.wireshark.org).
