This guide explores packet analysis using tshark and friends. If you do not have Wireshark installed and configured, [<i class="fas fa-map-marked"></i>  Start Here](/setup).
Otherwise, use the minimap or sidebar to find what you need.

This is a living, breathing guide. If youâ€™d like to contribute, [fork me on GitHub](https://github.com/pocc/tshark.dev).
