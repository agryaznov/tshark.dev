## TShark.dev

This guide provides an outline for packet analysis using tshark. tshark is the command-line part of [Wireshark](/setup/what_is_wireshark), which helps you troubleshoot networks. If you do not have Wireshark installed and configured, [<i class="fas fa-map-marked"></i>  Start Here](/setup).
Use the minimap or sidebar to find what you need.
