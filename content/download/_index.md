## Capture Sources

Sometimes it can be beneficial to use someone else's captures instead of your own.
Here are a couple reasons why this might make sense:

* You are learning how a protocol works and do not have access to the devices that use it
* You could capture traffic, but it would be faster to download an existing capture
* You are [writing a protocol dissector](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChDissectAdd.html) and need more test files

Whatever your reason, there are many repositories of public packet captures.
The largest collection of packet capture collections is [hosted by Netresec](https://www.netresec.com/?page=PcapFiles).
Of these, Wireshark's [Sample Captures](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures) is the most complete.

As part of this website, you can [search 6000+ captures](/download/search) by protocol or description.
