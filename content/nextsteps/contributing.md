## Tshark.dev

The README on the [Github repo](https://github.com/pocc/tshark.dev) is a good place to start.

If you want to bring up an issue about a page or the site generally, there are many ways, depending on your communication style:

* <u>**Edit this page**</u>: Every page has a link in the upper right corner that can click on to see the page in github.
* <u>**Comment**</u>: At the bottom of every article, there is a comments section that is tied to github issues.
* <u>**Email**</u>: If you do not want to use github, you can interact with the contributors by emailing tshark_dev[АТ]fire.fundersclub.com. This will make a github issue that functions like an email chain.
* <u>**Contact**</u>: If you do not want your issue to be public, you can contact me directly at rj[АТ]tshark.dev
