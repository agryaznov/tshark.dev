## Piping with *shark

Piping is important to using many of these utilities. For example, it is not
really possible to use rawshark without piping as it expects a FIFO or stream.

| Utility        | stdin formats        | input formats      | stdout formats     | output formats (default)    |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **capinfos**   | -                    | *pcaps<sup>1</sup> | report<sup>2</sup> | -                           |
| **dumpcap**    | -                    | -                  | rawpcap            | *pcaps (pcapng)<sup>3</sup> |
| **editcap**    | -                    | *pcaps             | -                  | *pcaps (pcapng)             |
| **mergecap**   | -                    | *pcaps             | -                  | *pcaps (pcapng)             |
| **randpkt**    | -                    | -                  | -                  | (pcap)                      |
| **rawshark**   | raw pcap<sup>4</sup> | -                  | report             | -                           |
| **reordercap** | -                    | *pcaps             | -                  | (Same as input)             |
| **text2pcap**  | hexdump<sup>5</sup>  | -                  | -                  | (pcap), pcapng              |
| **tshark**     | raw pcap             | *pcaps             | *many<sup>6</sup>  | *pcaps, (pcapng)            |

1. __*pcaps__: All pcap types available on the system (use `tshark -F` to list).
2. __report__: Tabular or "machine-readable" data about a file.
3. __()__: The default output file format for a given tool.
4. __raw pcap__:  The raw bytes of the pcap header and packets. Can be generated
  with `cat $file | ...`, read by piping to `... | tshark -r -`, and saved with
  `... > $file`.
5. __hexdump__: A formatted hexdump can be canonically generated by `od -Ax -tx1 -v`. As of
  Wireshark v3.0.0, `tshark -r <my.pcap> -x` will
  [usually](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14639) generate
  this as well. If hexdump is stream, send to text2pcap as
  `<commands>... | text2pcap - <outfile>`.  Otherwise if it's a file, use
  `text2pcap <infile> <outfile>`.
6. __*many__: Tshark is the most versatile in terms of output:
  - rawpcap (`-w -`)
  - Report (`-G`)
  - PDU Subtrees (`-V`)
  - Packet Representations (accessible with `-T`)
    - Line-based: One line per packet
      - text (default): Abbreviated packets with one per line
      - tabs: Same as text, but uses tab as delimiter
      - fields: Specify which values of the packet to show with [display filters]()
    - JSON-based
      - json: All the json, all the time.
      - jsonraw:
      - ek:
    - XML-based
      - pdml:
      - psml:
    - PS-based
      - ps: Adobe <u>**P**</u>ost<u>**S**</u>cript file that con be converted to pdf

## Using temp files instead of pipes

In bash, it's possible to create temporary files to mimic using a pipe. In
this example, editcap can only read files, so create a temp file, send filtered
tshark output to it, and then read it from editcap to make further alterations.

```bash
tempfile=$(mktemp)
tshark -r dhcp.pcap -Y "dhcp.type == 1" -w $tempfile
editcap $tempfile dhcp2.pcap -a 1:"Cool story bro!"
```

## Pipe Types

An anonymous pipe sends the output of one command to another.
A named pipe (aka FIFO) is a file created by `mkfifo` from which data can be read and to which data can be sent, by different processes.
More information about each can be found in this [stackexchange post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/436864/how-does-a-fifo-named-pipe-differs-from-a-regular-pipe-unnamed-pipe)

### Anonymous Pipe

In this example, tshark reads packets and sends the packet bytes to stdout. The stdout is written to the pipe which is sent to the stdin of a second tshark process.

```bash
# You may need to use sudo to capture
tshark -w - | tshark -r -
```

This is equivalent to `tshark -r $file`, only using a pipe and an extra tshark process to demonstrate send/recv on `|`.

{{% notice warning %}}
If you are reading from stdin, then the data stream MUST conform to a capture type that
tshark knows how to parse. This means, for example, that a pcap file needs to
send the pcap header first or the packets that come after won't be parsed.
{{% /notice %}}

### Named Pipe

You can also read from a pipe like so:

```bash
mkfifo myfifo
# You may need to use sudo to capture
tshark -w myfifo & tshark -i myfifo
```

Confusingly, reading a pipe is through `-i` even though a named pipe is a file descriptor.
