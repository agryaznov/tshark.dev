[Wireshark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark) is a tool used to visualize network issues.
It is well documented with the [Official Documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/),
the [manpages](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/), and the [Wireshark Forums](https://ask.wireshark.org), among others.
In addition to a GUI version, Wireshark comes with many command-line utilities like tshark.
