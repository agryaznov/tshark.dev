## Writing the message

When communicating your findings to others, you should any relevant details
that may help the person reading your message. For example:

* Devices/interfaces you gathered data off of. Include topologies as
appropriate.
* If you are not pre-filtering the packet capture, include the relevant filters.

Any message should have these gestalt elements (at the very least):

* What is the problem (one sentence)?
* How did you collect the packet capture?
* How does the packet capture demonstrate the problem?
* What should be done based upon that conclusion?
